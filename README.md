# Overview

I was tasked with creating a Quiz Game using mostly javascript.

========================================================

# function 

The game is loosely structured with an HTML file and then I grab the elements I need by their ID.

Now that i hae the IDs I can manipulate it with javascript. 

I can;
Add buttons,
Add event listeners,
class names,
you name it! javascript can probably do it!

The game has a top container that hold the view highscores button on the left, and timer on the right.
The start button displays in the center of the page.
Once the Quiz has started a question will be unhidden and three answer buttons will be generated.
The 60sec timer will also be triggered.
The user will select an answer and will be alerted if correct or incorrect. If incorrect, 10 seconds will be subtracted.
After the alert is closed another question will appear.
After the last question, a highscores list will appear. 
The score is determined by subtracting time left from total time, giving us the time it took to complete the quiz.
